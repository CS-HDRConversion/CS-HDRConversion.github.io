<b>Project Description</b><br>
 Supervised learning problems are one of the most intensively studied problems in machine learning. A fundamental assumption underlying most supervised learning problems is that the training and the test data are generated from the same underlying probability distribution. This assumption underpins both the research and applied "prediction industry". However, adversarial attacks are observed in many scenarios which aim to deceive a machine learning model. For example, a spammer may deliberately change the distribution of texts and images in spam emails so that spam filters (which are classifiers) routinely have to be retrained, or otherwise the adversarial distribution changes will cause the spam filter’s performance to deteriorate. As a result, the problem of "Adversarial Machine Learning" has attracted significant interest in the machine learning and data mining community.<br><br>Moreover, adversarial samples have also been proven very successful in attacking deep learning models. Recent literature shows that making small-magnitude subtle changes to image/text/network data can result in significant testing errors in well-trained CNN and DNN models. Since deep learning models are becoming one of the most popular AI techniques that are being equipped for industry and business sectors, the safety concerns behind the vulnerability of deep learning models need to be studied and addressed. This project targets to solve the above problem by developing cutting-edge machine learning techniques that are robust to adversarial attacks. <br><br>
<b>Selection Criteria</b><br>
 Applicants will have a degree related to computer science and a major related to AI / Data science. Due to funding constraints, this scholarship can only be granted to domestic students.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 Managing traffic represent a true challenge for all traffic centres around the world, especially under an ever growing urban population living in cities. The increased traffic congestion is linked to an increased data availability from transport modes in the city, whether is regular or public transport, shared or on-demand services, electric scooters, etc.<br><br>This PhD project aims to study and apply various Artificial Intelligence algorithms and build a smart modelling framework that would help manage traffic across all available modes in a city, under both regular and disrupted traffic conditions (incidents/public events/travel restrictions due to pandemics, etc.). This implies a combination of multidisciplinary research from computer science and transport modelling.<br><br>The first part of the PhD will focus on conducting an intensive state-of-art on the usage of AI techniques for managing transport across the globe, followed by the construction of a modelling framework on a real-city study. This will be alimented by the best performing machine and deep learning models to predict traffic congestion and travel patterns across all travel modes in advance. While recurrent traffic modelling back-up by AI can provide good insights on traffic patterns, incidents/public events or temporary travel restrictions are stochastic events which have unique features changing dynamically in time. The second part of this project will aim at extending the modelling framework for early anomaly detection across all transport modes which can help to release early traffic alarms to operators for taking action. The last part of the PhD will consist in consolidating results and writing up the PhD thesis. Some examples of previous works on this topic can be found in [1]-[5].<br>
<b>Selection Criteria</b><br>
 Interested candidates must have solid background knowledge in computer science – machine and deep learning/data science and desirably transport modelling. Experience with handling large and complex data sets and strong Python programming skills are a big plus. We are looking for a candidate with a master by research qualification and demonstrated research capabilities (preferably through publications). Candidates with publications in major conferences/journals will be prioritised. The position will be open until the ideal candidate is identified.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 The utilization of text-based deep learning models, such as ChatGPT, has reached a level of significance that has the potential to revolutionize daily tasks and activities. However, these models are often limited to a single modality, specifically the domain of language. In contrast, real-world activities and events commonly incorporate multiple modalities, including visual (images/videos), audio (sounds/music/voice), and text (language), presenting a multimodal problem.<br><br>The present project aims to develop novel Transformers that can handle multimodal information. Transformers are models that form the underlying framework for ChatGPT and other GPT models. The intended functionalities of such models include generating text stories from image inputs generating images from music inputs, generating music from a text story, and so forth. Developing these advanced multimodal Transformers requires a thorough understanding of several cutting-edge multimodal deep learning models, with a target to improve their performance.<br>
<b>Selection Criteria</b><br>
 Prospective students for this project should have a background in computer science with a focus on artificial intelligence, either through their academic degrees or practical experience. Additionally, they should be eager to expand their knowledge and skills in the field of AI to support their research with the project's objectives.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) brings new interactive experience in a real-world environment. However, the user still majorly relies on controllers as the interface. A popular application is the multimodal brain-computer interface (BCI) which integrates multiple physiological patterns to estimate the level of cognitive ability or human intention. BCI research aims to expand our understanding of the cognitive functions underlying human perceptual, cognitive, and motor functioning. Considerable progress has been made in improving the estimation accuracy of BCI using various sensor technologies, there is a new direction to leverage multimodal BCI for developing VR- or AR-related approaches that can bring new insights or concepts into future life. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and state-of-the-art data analytics algorithms may also be introduced during the whole project. The students who have high interests in VR, AR, data analytics, AI, or BCI are particularly encouraged to apply.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 One of the most challenging areas in Knowledge Engineering are complex networked systems (CSN) ranging from the infrastructural networks (Internet, WWW, energy and transportation networks) to the natural ones (biological networks, social networks and ecosystems). The structure of large-scale networks is irregular, complex and constantly evolving. These networks consist of highly interconnected dynamical units that influence one another and whose behaviour is continuously influenced by external context. As an example, dynamics of a social network can be influenced by geography or political movements; think of how Covid-19 lock-down rules affected our social circles.<br>The analysis of such complex systems requires a lot of effort in both developing the tools and approaches to tackle them as well as understanding the nature and functioning of such networks. So far, the key building elements of complex networks were identified and their properties and behaviour are known. Yet current complex network analysis approaches rarely incorporate the different layers of contextual information associated with network elements.<br>This work proposes to represent contextual information of elements in a dynamic complex network (node attributes/edge attributes) as a knowledge graph and develop algorithm/s that will utilise the knowledge graph in complex network analytics tasks such as community detection and influence detection.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 Electric Vehicle have started to be more and more adopted in various cities around the globe with the hopes of reducing traffic pollution and provide safe and green travel alternatives. However, their adoption is not straightforward and their impact on the local traffic grid or air pollution is highly underestimated. This PhD aims at studying the impact of EV adoption by using a combination of traffic modelling and data science techniques. The work will include the delivery of an analysis platform/framework that connects robust fine-grained local transport simulation with local energy system modelling to explore the electric vehicle (EV) impacts on road usage and battery charging demand. The platform will enable users to test different EV scenarios and explore the emergent effects of local EV patterns on medium-voltage distribution networks and the consumers they service, both now and into the future. Some of the main objectives of this PhD are:<br>•	Building a microsimulation modelling in Aimsun for traffic congestion evaluation in an Australian city where traffic data is available,<br>•	Constructing EV recharge stations in the model and implementing routing towards the recharge stations of regular cars,<br>•	Testing various scenarios concerning the energy consumption and future evolution based on current/predicted traffic flow patterns,<br>•	Construct models and algorithms for optimising the location of EV recharge stations. <br>•	Write the manuscript and present results across several conferences or via journal publications. <br> <br>The PhD student will be located within the Future Mobility Lab at UTS (www.fmlab.org) under the supervision of Dr. Simona Mihaita. Domestic students are highly encouraged to apply.<br><br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 eXplainable AI (XAI) aims to produce models that enable humans to understand, trust, and manage the AI systems without compromising performance. Though open-source tools, such as IBM AI Explainability 360 toolkit and LIME, are getting traction, they lack a sound knowledge representation to capture all dimensions of an AI system, from data lineage to analytics pipeline and associated contextual and domain knowledge. It is evident from the literature that knowledge-enabled systems can ensure interoperability, support provenance, adapt to user’s needs, and include explanation facilities that enhance end-user trust. Hence, this project aims to propose meta-models and methodologies that utilise semantic web technologies for analytics knowledge representation and management, as well as new and meaningful ways that end-users can interact with knowledge-enabled AI systems, such as visualisations and text synthesis. <br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 In the current era of digital economy, recommender systems (RSs) have been playing a key role to help end users like you and me to quickly find out any products, contents and/or services which interest them.  Actually, recommender systems have been in nearly every corner of our daily life, ranging from eating, dressing, housing to traveling.  For example, Youtube uses RSs to recommend videos to its users to maximize its profit. <br><br>However, due to the success of RSs, a big issue is that there is usually a variety of bias in recommendation results, leading to unfair experience of the end users. For instance, some RSs may only make accurate recommendations to the majority of users/items, while performing poor for those minority groups. Bias may also exist for different groups of users, e.g., an RSs may perform differently among different groups of users, such as male users or female users, young users or older group. The bias may come from the data used for build the RS models, or from the model itself. To provide fair recommendation results and further improve the experience and satisfaction of different groups of users, it is necessary to build fair RS. <br><br>This project aims to develop advanced machine learning driven RSs models and algorithms so as to provide fair recommendation results to different groups of users. The expected outcome will not only advance the progress in RS research community and ethical AI community, but also benefit building a more fair and satisfied consumption environment, community and society. <br><br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 Class imbalance occurs when the distribution of classes is not uniform across samples. This fundamental machine learning problem is observed in many fields, e.g. cyberattacks, border security, and defence. It is still an open data analytics challenge due to the significance of accurately predicting the samples of the minority classes, i.e., identifying a few hostile anomalies such as attack instances in network data is more important than recognising non-attack ones. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) [5] is a state-of-the-art model in deep learning which aims to generate synthetic information, e.g., images and texts. In the presence of class imbalance, the main challenges of the data augmentation method are to produce synthetic samples from the scarce minority classes that are diverse and plausible. A common problem of a GANs is mode collapse, where the GAN generator produces samples from one or a small subset of outputs. This issue leads to generating samples that are neither diverse nor plausible. Several methods have been proposed to oversample the minority class using conditional GAN (cGAN) [2], but these methods can cause overfitting [8].<br>This study aims to propose a Multimodal Balanced Conditional GANs to enhance the diversity of the generated samples by learning features from multiple modalities such as a combination of images, text, videos, etc. (i.e., instead of one of them as in the unimodal approach). The proposed method contains a data fusion module that aims to create a joint representation features layer from the multiple modalities of the labeled and unlabeled actual data. Then the extracted features from joint layer will be used as input to the Balancer, which adds extra diversity in the feature space that the original actual samples lack.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 This project aims to propose and develop solutions for generating multimodal content (such as images+text, text+ratings, etc.), using graph-enhanced techniques. The project will focus on developing models that can effectively integrate information from multiple modalities and generate coherent content by leveraging the relational information of graphs.<br><br>One of the key challenges in multimodal content generation is how to effectively integrate information from multiple sources, such as text, images, and ratings, into a single coherent output. This requires a good understanding of the relationships between different modalities and the ability to reason about them in a structured and systematic way. Graph-enhanced models provide a natural framework for representing and reasoning about relationships between different modalities, and have shown promise in a variety of natural language processing and computer vision tasks.<br><br>The project will focus on developing and evaluating graph-enhanced models for a range of multimodal content generation tasks, such as image and text generation ( for tasks like invitation card generation, logo and brand name generation, TCG card generation, etc), text and rating genration (for tasks like product review generation). <br><br>The goal of the project is to develop more effective and efficient solutions for multimodal content generation that can generate coherent content across multiple modalities. These solutions have the potential to enable a range of new applications and use cases, such as automated content generation for social media, advertising, e-commerce and game industry.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 Reinforcement learning, along with supervised learning and unsupervised learning, is one of the three core machine learning paradigms. As the backbone techniques for many AI systems, such as autonomous driving and robotics, reinforcement learning has demonstrated great potential and earned huge attention from the research community. However, existing reinforcement learning suffers from numerous issues that impede it from being widely applied to real-world scenarios, including low data-efficiency and noisy and incomplete environment information. This project aims to investigate the incorporation of human-in-the-loop learning into reinforcement learning, which will address not only the challenges of reinforcement learning, but also some long-standing cruxes of human-in-the-loop learning.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 The AI tool, ChatGPT, is a state-of-the-art language generation model that has been developed by OpenAI. It utilizes transformer architecture and has been trained on a massive amount of data from the internet. One of its key features is its ability to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. It allows it to perform various language tasks such as answering questions, translating languages, summarizing text, generating stories, and more. Additionally, it can continue a given text prompt, making it a useful tool for chatbots and virtual assistants. The primary goal of ChatGPT is to enhance natural language processing capabilities and provide users with more conversational and human-like interactions.<br><br>In the context of education, ChatGPT has become an essential tool, particularly in online exams and formal assessments. It enables students to produce pieces of knowledge they need to write themselves. However, to ensure that students are genuinely producing their own knowledge and not relying on AI tools like ChatGPT, this project utilizes machine learning methods to detect the student's submitted text, whether generated by humans or AI tools. This study is the first of its kind to address this issue. It will be of greate help to educators and reviewers in ensuring that students are producing their own knowledge, which they have learned from their respective institutions or schools to produce required responses.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 This project proposes a novel approach combining geometry processing and machine learning to automate the creation of a high-value, fit-for-purpose 3D mesh from an unstructured 3D points cloud, as may be acquired from a 3D scanner or RGBD camera.<br>We aim to create an automatic pipeline capable of converting an input point cloud into a proper base mesh that resembles the modelled artists. <br>We will achieve this goal by analysing and training a knowledge base with an extensive database of manually-modelled meshes to model the connection between shape and the underlying connectivity. We apply supervised learning on the dataset of modelled meshes to understand how the connectivity is related to geometric features at different scales. Then <br>We exploit this knowledge to build a novel \emph{reverse-modelling} tool capable of replicating the manual modelling process on an input point cloud. <br>Specifically, we aim to:<br><br>1. Design a novel set of 3D shape descriptors that are capable of representing and transferring mesh connectivity. <br><br>2. Design the first system that is able to deeply understand how the mesh structure is related to object shape, identity and function at multiple scales;<br><br>3. Exploit deeply trained model to build a novel software pipeline that automatically converts captured 3D data into high-value 3D meshes for use in downstream applications.<br><br>Industrial production pipelines like CG animation, games, Computer-Aided-Design or Architecture (fig \ref{fig:base_meshes}.c) require polygonal meshes to model the structure and function of the object as well as its surface shape. These compact, highly informative 3D assets are referred to as \emph{Base Meshes}. Currently, the base meshes are mostly manually designed by skilled artists, which is time, costly and inefficient.<br><br>However, automatically converting arbitrary real-world objects to proper base meshes would open new paths for the entertainment and manufacturing industry. <br>While the reconstructed model might be very accurate, the underlying structure is significantly different from that designed by the artist. Artists enrich the 3D shape with semantic features encoded in the connectivity. Besides their compactness, the connectivity of manually modelled meshes is usually optimised for its target function. For example, in the case of a character, the meshes are optimised to produce proper deformations when animated. Creating a base mesh that effectively captures these semantic properties, and is not cluttered with irrelevant features, is known as Reverse-modelling or Re-topology.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 The relationship between road infrastructure and economic development is widely studied as 25 million kilometres of new roads will be built by 2050. The vegetated strips of land located near roads that separate them from the surrounding landscape called roadside or road verges are affected by this growth in road infrastructure. Recent studies have shown that roadside plays an important role to mitigate roads impacts on the territory and its ecosystems. A sustainable management of these green spaces can provide different ecosystem services that can improve the citizen’s life conditions. Indeed, the maintenance of roadsides integrates several issues with various aspects: (i) economic (e.g. continuous investment in the maintenance equipment, the attractiveness of the territories linked to the quality of the maintained landscape), (ii) technological (e.g. the biomass valorisation, the reduction of the carbon footprint), (iii) social (e.g. road safety, flood and fire prevention) and (iv) environmental (e.g. the preservation of the biodiversity, the water improvement, the air and soil quality, etc.). <br>Roadside maintenance is complex because it depends on many factors (economic, environmental, climatological, organizational), which can make the optimization of work sites difficult. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques offer alternative computational approaches to learn from data and optimize routing processes. AI has proven effective in tackling ill-defined problems, learning from experience, and managing uncertainty and incomplete data. This subject is interested in identifying the optimal route through AI-based algorithms considering traffic circulation, the territory’s characteristics (risks areas, intersections, the presence of ditches, a ligneous vegetation…), the machine speed or multiple destinations for example. In this project, territories will be able to serve as areas of experimentation.<br><br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 Recent advancement in digital fabrication has significantly changed the strategies to deliver digital shapes to reality. Additive manufacturing techniques decouple the fabrication effort from the underlying shape complexity. They are capable of fabricating arbitrary complex shapes with incredible accuracy and local control of implied materials. Such impressive, expressive power allows designing objects with complex functionalities or beautiful structural properties that were impossible to fabricate with traditional production assets. <br>Unfortunately, despite the recent democratisation of 3D printing technologies, their applications are significantly limited by the lack of tools for content creation. Most of the available software for shape modelling is designed having in mind the classical 3D industrial manufacturing techniques and does not take into consideration the potential provided by new fabrication devices. The industry is nowadays requiring a new generation of tools to create an innovative advanced functional component. This new generation of computational design algorithms will consent an artist to focus only on the aesthetics and high-level functionality of the design, while all other practical considerations regarding the physical realisation and fine-scale material distribution are taken care of by an algorithm in the background. Despite the enormous interests from industry, the existing approaches for predicting and optimising the material properties of objects are too slow and can exploit only a small fraction of the resolution and the capabilities offered by modern fabrication technologies.<br><br>This project proposes a substantial rethinking of the current computational design pipeline. Its primary goal is to investigate scalable algorithms to support the design of surfaces with predictable structural properties and their integration with modern fabrication pipelines. This objective can be pursued using an innovative approach: integrating recent advancements in shape analysis and geometry processing with physically based analysis to create a new generation of interactive tools capable of simulating, anticipating and optimising the fabricated object's physical behaviour. This new methodology will take into account fabric-ability constraints and functional goals. A vital aspect of the project is to rely on low-dimension domains that allow for efficient global optimisation and user control. The results will be evaluated for functional goals, such as structural or mechanical properties, aesthetics and fabrication constraints.<br>

 Small object detection with remote sensing imagery is a crucial task in identifying and locating small objects, such as vehicles, buildings, or geological formations, in satellite or aerial imagery. This task has a wide range of applications, including agriculture, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, detecting small objects in remote sensing imagery is challenging due to the small size of the objects and the complex background environment. Traditional object detection techniques, such as those used in computer vision, may not be suitable for this task due to the differences in image characteristics and the scale of the objects.<br><br>To address these challenges, advanced deep learning algorithms and techniques are being developed to accurately detect small objects in remote sensing imagery while being computationally efficient and scalable. These techniques leverage the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are capable of extracting rich spatial and spectral features from the imagery. Additionally, multi-scale analysis and feature fusion can be used to detect objects at different scales and in different contexts.<br><br>Accurate and efficient small object detection in remote sensing imagery can lead to better decision-making in various applications, such as precision agriculture, disaster response, and wildlife monitoring. The development of advanced algorithms and techniques for small object detection with remote sensing imagery is an important area of research that has the potential to impact a range of fields and improve our understanding of the natural and built environments.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 Spatial-temporal anomaly detection is a critical process in identifying unusual events or patterns that occur in both space and time. This process involves analyzing data that is both spatially and temporally correlated to detect anomalies that cannot be identified using traditional anomaly detection techniques. Applications of spatial-temporal anomaly detection include video surveillance, environmental monitoring, and financial fraud detection.<br><br>To address the challenges of anomaly detection in complex systems, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a promising solution. STGNNs operate on graphs that represent the spatio-temporal relationships between the components of the system being monitored. They have shown great potential in various applications, including detecting financial fraud, predicting traffic flow, and identifying anomalies in social networks.<br><br>Despite the promising results of STGNNs, there is still much research to be done to improve their performance and scalability. This research project aims to identify the limitations of current spatio-temporal anomaly detection methods and utilize STGNNs to address these limitations. By capturing complex spatio-temporal relationships, scaling to large systems with many components, and adapting to changes in the system over time, STGNNs could offer an effective solution for anomaly detection in complex systems.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 The sharing of short videos on social media platforms such as TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels has gained tremendous popularity among the young generation. Despite existing policies on these platforms that govern what can be uploaded, there have been many instances where age-restricted video content has been inadvertently exposed to children. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop an accurate and reliable machine learning model that can automatically classify video content.<br><br>One of the primary challenges in classifying video content is the heterogeneity of video data. Videos comprise not just image frames, but also audio (soundtrack) and text (language) information, thereby creating a multimodal problem. The absence of an effective multimodal machine learning model that can handle such data complicates the classification of video content.<br><br>This project aims to address the aforementioned issue by developing advanced machine learning models that can learn from all visual, audio, and language data to filter videos. The proposed solution will make online social platforms a safe space for people of all ages.<br>
<b>Selection Criteria</b><br>
 Applications will have a Honours or Master's degree in computer science, and have knowledge and experience in machine learning.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 In an era of rapid technological changes, connected, electric and autonomous vehicles (CAEVs) seem to be the perfect solution for dealing with challenging problems such as congestion, pollution and space optimisation in urban areas. While significant efforts are put together for dealing with regulations, standard adoption and testing some trial cases, few studies have concentrated on studying the impact of adopting such novel technology and the problems coming along with operating in mixed traffic environments.<br><br>This PhD project aims at proposing both theoretical and transport modelling techniques in order to build an efficient traffic control mechanism responsible of balancing a shared and on-demand CAEV fleet across various urban areas and maintain a high level of service that would minimise travel time for all vehicles on the road (either autonomous, public transport, taxis, etc.). The underlying operational problem associated with the shared on-demand CAEVs is a sequential stochastic control problem with incoming dynamic requests for rideshare, routing optimisation and electrical recharge constraints. In the first part of this project, the PhD student will develop an agent-based simulation tool (or a micro simulation model) for modelling the CAEV behaviour in a real urban setup and testing multiple assignment strategies [1]-[2]. This would include communication between vehicles and route optimisation for arriving in time at random recharge stations across the city subject to specific recharging constraints. Secondly, the focus will be on developing a controller supervision system that would allow traffic operators to balance the traffic demand and CAEV fleet allocation across large urban areas in order to ease traffic congestion [3]. This would take into consideration a dynamic fleet reconfiguration which would operate under safe navigation conditions [4-5].<br>
<b>Selection Criteria</b><br>
 Interested candidates must have solid background knowledge in transport modelling, traffic control and mathematical modelling (preferably stochastic optimal control, dynamic routing), and strong programming capabilities in Python/R. Experience with transport modelling at micro and meso levels are a big plus. We are looking for a candidate with a master by research qualification and demonstrated research capabilities (publications). Candidates with publications in major conferences/journals will be prioritised. The position will be open until the ideal candidate is identified.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 Many real-world problems include datasets that contain only positive and unlabeled examples. For instance, a dataset includes a list of customers who have bought some items (positive) and others who might or might not purchase the items (unalabeld). This approach is known as positive and unalabeld learning. In this problem, the negative examples are not known, which may be part of unlabeled set. Generative adversarial learning (GAN) is a deep generative model to generate synthetic images. It is successfully applied in several domains, including medical, cybersecurity, etc. In this approach, we tackle the binary PU learning task by generating synthetic positive and negative real-like samples and then train a standard classifier using the synthetic positive and negative samples.<br>

<b>Project Description</b><br>
 In many application areas, such as animation, games and architectural design, it is sufficient to model only the surfaces of 3D objects. This representation is adequate when the model's appearance is the primary concern, but if the interior structure and material properties are important, a more sophisticated approach is required. Volumetric Meshes go beyond the surface to model the interiors of 3D objects offering a richer representation than classical 3D surface meshes. Because of their capacity to encode volumetric structural and material properties, volumetric meshes are the fundamental input for all applications that need to simulate and evaluate an object's physical behaviour when subject to external forces. Applications range from automotive to naval, aerospace, medical and geological industries.<br><br>Volumetric meshes are composed of polyhedra adjacent to one another along shared faces, edges, and vertices. Specifically, hexahedral-meshes (or hex-meshes) are Volumetric meshes composed exclusively of cubes (or hexahedral elements). Hexahedral elements are considered the best solution to represent discrete volumes because of the provided accuracy and efficiency in solving the partial differential equations (PDEs) required in physically-based simulation. Despite their central role in applied sciences, it is surprising to observe that the computation of a high-quality hexahedral mesh conforming to (or suitably approximating) a target geometry remains a challenge with various open aspects for which no fully satisfactory solutions have been provided yet. Improving or merging two volumetric meshes are unsolved problems for which robust solutions do not exist. Despite the many advancements in the field, the hex-meshing problem has been so inaccessible that it is considered the "holy grail" of mesh processing.<br><br>The project aims to define a new technology that starts from a simple shape (a single cube) and then applies refining operations until the volumetric dataset converges to the target shape. This technique mimics the usual box modelling technique commonly used by artists to create 3D characters. Suppose we encode instructions as a text sequence. In that case, we can learn how they are related to the target shape, and then exploit this knowledge to synthesise the correct instructions for a given input shape to generate the relative hex mesh. <br>
