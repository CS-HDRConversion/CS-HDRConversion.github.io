			 We didn’t sign up for this. <br>The Internet and social media were supposed to be connected sources of information, guaranteeing universal access to truth. Instead, we got drowned – with social media acting as<br>its primary carrier, propaganda and misinformation spread more expansive than ever before. We are observing a flurry of damaging activity – from vaccine opposition groups riding a once-in-a-century pandemic to far-right groups pushing extremist and racial targeting content.<br><br>How can you help? <br>The Behavioral Data Science lab is looking for several PhD students to join us in<br>detecting, modelling, and countering online misinformation. We require a wide range of skills and interests. We look for (computational) social scientists to investigate the sources and patterns of adoption forensically. We require mathematicians and applied statisticians to develop the information spread models. We need machine learners and data scientists to deploy at-scale neural network technologies for language and image analysis.<br>

			<b>Project Description</b><br>
			 Drones are no longer limited to simple surveillance or mapping tasks. They are now being deployed for complex missions such as monitoring, agriculture, infrastructural investigation, and delivery of essential supplies. To handle these tasks effectively, autonomous and real-time control is essential. This project aims to develop intelligent control algorithms to achieve that based on sequential Bayesian optimization. Sequential Bayesian optimization is a powerful methodology for optimizing expensive and block-box objective functions and has found success across various domains, including the sciences and engineering. This project will investigate new Sequential Bayesian optimization algorithms to achieve autonomous and real-time drone control for complex missions. <br>

			<b>Project Description</b><br>
			 The increasing accumulation of historical human knowledge significantly challenges knowledge innovation in both vertical and horizontal dimensions. The recombination of cross-disciplinary knowledge with a group of scientists from multiple research domains to advance knowledge boundaries has become an efficient and effective solution for scientific innovation. Despite a large-scale depository of scientific outcomes in academic knowledge graphs, measuring knowledge complementarity across multiple disciplines and teaming scientists with diverse backgrounds in terms of research disciplines and demographical diversity to achieve the predictable potential of knowledge innovation have long been a practical obstacle for scientific research and development, science policy, and entrepreneurship. This project aims to develop a responsible recommender system for innovation-driven, fair, and cross-disciplinary scientific collaborations. This project will touch on research areas like recommender systems, graph representation learning, text analytics, social network analytics, etc. <br><br>Research topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br>•	Heterogeneous entity extraction and relationship discovery in knowledge graphs<br>•	Fair/explainable graph representation learning<br>•	Fair teaming recommendations with knowledge graphs<br><br>

			 Modern 3D sensor technologies allow efficient digital reproductions of many real-world objects. However, the produced 3D data is usually organized as a point cloud or a triangle mesh. While this data may accurately represent an object's shape, it is unsuitable for most applications beyond simple viewing. For example, production pipelines like CG animation, games, Computer-Aided-Design or Architecture require polygonal meshes to model the structure and function of the object as well as its surface shape. These compact, highly informative 3D assets are referred to as Base Meshes.<br><br>The automatic conversion of a 3D scanned real-world object to a suitable base mesh is a complex and intriguing open problem. Creating a base mesh that effectively captures these semantic properties and is not cluttered with irrelevant features is known as reverse modelling or Re-topology. Such processes convert input 3D data into a more readable, usable, and abundant structure in semantics. Despite significant efforts, state-of-the-art automatic methods still produce results that are considerably different from ones modelled by artists. As a result, base meshes are always manually designed by skilled artists, which is time costly and inefficient. <br><br>In this project, we will define a new generation of re-meshing techniques that can interpret and optimize the quality of a tessellation by analyzing its similarity to manually modelled meshes. We will use deep learning techniques in concurrence with differential geometry to learn and replicate the subtle bond between a shape and its ideal tessellation.<br>

			<b>Project Description</b><br>
			 Strategic planning in response to disasters distinctly differs from strategic planning in everyday situations. Similarly, the use of IT in normal cases does not necessarily work in emergency environments. However, people are becoming more exposed and vulnerable to social and environmental changes, ranging from natural disasters like earthquakes and floods to uncertainties caused by issues related to climate change. Many debates have been about implementing resilience thinking, allowing communities to prepare for possible stresses and shocks. Although frameworks aim to build inclusive resilience strategies fostering participation and engagement, there is limited resilience-related literature on conceptualizing participation in strategic road mapping.<br><br>Many natural disasters take place every year with a great impact on society. This project will focus on finding the opportunities and challenges of using digital technologies in natural disasters from the lens of communities. After overviewing what technologies exist, how they are used, what their use brings in, and what information science could offer to improve challenges, the study aims to match them to particular needs arising at disasters. The final report will contribute to increasing the resilience of communities and getting ready for radical climate change.<br><br>
